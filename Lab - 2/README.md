## Task 1: Calculate Source Lines of Code (SLOC)

In this task, the goal is to calculate the Source Lines of Code (SLOC) for a given code file. The SLOC count refers to the number of lines in the code excluding comments.

Here's how to proceed:

1. Locate the "Codes" directory.
2. Inside, there will find a file named `t1_sloc_go.py`, which is used for this task.
3. Run the `t1_sloc_go.py` script using Python.
 
   ```
   python Codes/t1_sloc_go.py
   ```
5. The calculated SLOC will be displayed in the console output.

## Task 2: Identify Changes Between Two Code Versions

In this task, we need to work with two versions of a code file to determine the changes that have occurred, including additions, deletions, and the total number of changes.

To accomplish this task:

1. Navigate to the "Codes" directory.
2. Inside, we will find two files named `fileA` and `fileB`, which are used for this task.
3. Run the `t2_changes.py` script using Python.

   ```
   python Codes/t2_changes.py
   ```
5. The output will be saved in a file named `t2_changes_count.txt` and will also be displayed in the console.

## Task 3: Compare Source Code Repository Versions

This task involves comparing two versions of a source code repository to identify file changes, additions, deletions, and the overall changes for each file.

To complete this task:

1. Access the "Codes" directory.
2. 'test-repo' contains a sample go Project. And using git logs, we found out 2 commits and used their SHA values for this task.
3. Run the `t3_repo_no.py` script using Python.

   ```
   python Codes/t3_repo_no.py
   ```
5. The output will be saved in a file named `t3_output.txt` and will also be displayed in the console.
